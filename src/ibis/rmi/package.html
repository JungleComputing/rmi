This is an RMI implementation on top of Ibis.

This package and its sub-packages implement an (incomplete)
version of Java RMI on top of the Ibis communication layer.

The most notable difference with "ordinary" Java RMI applications is that
an Ibis RMI application must start its own RMI registry. In addition,
the Ibis RMI package is called ibis.rmi and not java.rmi. However,
the Ibis rmic takes care of that by rewriting the bytecode, so the user
can use java.rmi, as long as the Ibis RMI rmic is used.
